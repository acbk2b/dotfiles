# DotFiles

Home for all of my various customization things

## Specs

- OS: Arch Linux
  - btw
- WM: Qtile
  - Favorite WM I have tried, good balance of functionality, customization, and easy config
- Terminal: Alacritty
  - Fast, vim-mode, just works

## Active Configs

- alacritty
- dwm 
  - See [my build][https://github.com/acbk2b/dwm]
- lf
- neovim
- qtile
- zsh
  - Requires external plugins:
    - vi-mode
    - zsh-autosuggestions
    - zsh-syntax-highlighting

## Archived Configs

Things I have used in the past (for varying periods of time), but no longer used

- awesome
  - Very briefly used
- bspwm 
  - Used for a reasonable amount of time, moved on in preference of more dynamic tilers
- i3
  - I like the way i3 handles multi-monitors, but don't like the plain-text config and manual tiling
- polybar
  - Used with bspwm, no need with qtile or dwm
- xmonad
  - Very powerful WM
  - Not a huge fan of Haskell
    - Functional programming language
    - Annoying dependencies/updates, 100+ packages 400+MB for full install, and they ALL update frequently
